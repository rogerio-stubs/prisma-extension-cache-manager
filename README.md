# prisma-extension-cache-manager
This project is an easy to use cache manager that provides compatibility with Prisma and Nestjs. I don't want to reinvent the wheel, so I'll use Prisma's $extends and Nestjs's cache-manager.
## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
npm install prisma-extension-cache-manager
```
